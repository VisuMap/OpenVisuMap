1 installed pip by: (1) download get-pip.py file; (2) run the command "python get-pip.py".

2 Download and installed "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3" from
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=53587

3 Run command "pip install tensorflow"

4 run "python test.py" to test matmul() reported some error relating to " unknown op: BestSplits "

5 Downloaded tensorflow-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl from 
   http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-win/85/
  Then installed it with "pip install tensorflow***.whl"
  After this, the error of (4) disappeared. Just 3 warning related to SSE are reported.

6 python -m pip install Pillow

7 pip install ipython

8 saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.all_variables())
  saver.save(sess,"checkpoint.data")

9: pip install tensorflow
   pip install tensorflow-gpu
   pip uninstall tensorflow

10: downloaded and upgraded to: tensorflow-1.1.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl; 
   The gpu version tensorflow_gpu-1.1.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl does not work: some problem with swig.
   The working gpu version is tensorflow_gpu-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl, but is 
   30% slower than the CPU version.

11 Installing MxNet:
   python setup.py install
    
12:Installing Lasagne on windows after Theano:
     pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip

13: To use keras with theano: run vcvarsall.bat in the following dir once:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC

14: Upgrading to tensorflow 1.4 with: pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
    Upgrading to tensorflow with GPU: pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
    The gpu version requires upgrading cudnn from v5.0 to v6.0

15: Upgraded to tensorflow 1.5, but the performance degraded for FFClassification.md.py & Pictures.xvmz & 100 epochs
    from 108 seconds to 208 secons. So, I downgraded 1.4

16: Downloaded and installed tensorflow 1.7. But, tensorflow failed to get imported with some ImportDDL error. Presumbly
    because the windows desktop computer does support AVX extension. So, I downgraded to tensorflow 1.4
