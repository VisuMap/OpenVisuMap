The MultivaraiteAnalysis plugin&nbsp;extends VisuMap with services
for variouse type of &nbsp;multivariate data analysis. Currently
the plugin provides&nbsp;the following services:<br>
<ul>
<li>Linear Discreminate Analysis (LDA).<br>
</li>
<li>Partial Least Squares (PLS) Analysis.<br>
</li>
<li>Cannonic Correlation Analysis (CCA).</li>
</ul>
All three services are linear data analysis with so called<span style="font-style: italic;"> projection
pursuit </span>strategy:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
they try to find limited number of directions in the high dimensional
space, so that the projection of a data set to these directions will
maximize certain properties. So for instance, the LDA method tries
to find a set of directions, so that different types of data points
will have maximal <span style="font-style: italic;">separatation</span>
after
the projection. Figure 1 illustrates how LDA find a direction that
maximally separates two types of data points. Notice that the method of
princimpal
component analysis (PCA) is also a projection pursuit method, as it
finds directions that maximize the variance of the whole dataset.<br>

PLS method provides basically&nbsp;opposite service as LDA: whereas
LDA
tries to find features (rotation direction) to distinguish groups of
data points; PLS tries to find common features between data
groups.&nbsp;More particularily, for two given data
points set X and Y in a high dimensional space, PLS algorithm finds TWO
sets of directions, so that the projection of X and Y to these two sets
of directions will have maximal <span style="font-style: italic;">covariance</span>
with each other. Figure 2 illustrates how PLS finds a direction for two
data point sets, so that the projection of the two sets will have
maximal covariance with each other.<br>

The CCA method works very similarly as PLS with the exception that
CCA&nbsp;maximizes the <span style="font-style: italic;">correlation
</span>&nbsp;of
the projected data instead of their covariance. &nbsp;Since, unlike
the
covariance, the correlation is in general independent on the scaling
range of the data, CCA can be applied to data set with different
scaling range ( by ignoring the scaling information). On the otherside,
PLS will preserve the scaling information and is therefore normally
only appropriate to explore data with common&nbsp;scaling range. It
should&nbsp;be pointed out that &nbsp;CCA, as projection
method, does
not perserve the scaling, since its projection base vectors are
normally not orthogonal.<br>
<br>
As common to all projection prusit methods,&nbsp;directions found
by
LDA,
PLS are&nbsp;orthogonal unit vectors, and each direction is
associated with a factor, &nbsp;called the eigenvalue, that
indicates how much that direction contributes to the to-be maximized
property. In practices, it is often sufficient to explore just few
directions with the largest eigenvalues. Becouse of this
characteristics,&nbsp;these methods are sometimes used as <span style="font-style: italic;">dimensionality reduction</span>
methods.<br>

</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <strong>Using
the MultivariateAnalysis plugin<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><small>The
MultivariateAnalysis plugin is delivered as a zipped directory file
<code>MultivariateAnalysis.zip</code>. &nbsp;The plugin
is installed&nbsp;as
following:</small><br>
</span></strong></span>
<ol>
<li>Decompress MultivariateAnalysis.zip.<br>
</li>
<li>Start VisuMap application.<br>
</li>
<li>Press F5 in VisuMap; then, when prompt for a script
file,&nbsp;select the file SetupMva.js.</li>
</ol>
After the installation, the plugin will offer its service through the
plugin object named "MultivariateAnalysis". The user can obtain a
reference to this object in a script by the statement <code>"var
mva
=&nbsp;vv.FindPluginObject("MultivariateAnalysis");"</code>.
Please see the chapter "VisuMap.MultiVariateAnalysis NameSpace" of this
document for more information about how to use this plugin object.<br>
<br>
For the sake of convienence the installation procedure also
installs&nbsp;three&nbsp;context menus to enable users to do
services on selected data. The three context menus are&nbsp;as
following:<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do LDA</span>:
Perform LDA
analysis on selected data. The selected data points should have at
least two different types. This operation will display the projected
data in a 3D view window.&nbsp; You can perform binary LDA by
marking some
data points as highlighted (through the common context menu), then
select another set of data points, and then choose this context menu.
When doing binary LDA, the algorithm will just find a direction that
maximally separates the two selected data point sets.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do PLS</span>:
&nbsp;Perform PLS
analysis. In order to use this service, first mark a set data points as
highlighted (through the common context menu); then selec
another set of data points; then choose this context mneu.
&nbsp;This operation will display the projections of the two
selected
data point sets&nbsp;in two value diagram windows.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Do CCA<span style="font-weight: normal;">:&nbsp;Perform CCA
analysis. In order to use this service, first marks a set
of data points as highlighted (through the common context menu);
then select another set of data points; then choose this context
mneu. &nbsp;This operation will display the projections of the two
selected
data point sets&nbsp;in two value diagram windows.</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>In order to
uninstall the MultivariateAnalysis plugin just press F5 in VisuMap,
then choose the script UninstallMva.js.<br>
